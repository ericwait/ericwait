## Hi, I'm Eric 👋

**GPU/ML Systems Engineer | Building efficient AI at the intersection of physics and deep learning**

I architect high-performance machine learning systems that process terabyte-scale data in real-time. My approach combines domain knowledge with modern AI to create interpretable, deployable solutions that respect the physics of the problem space.

### 🧠 Philosophy: "The Best Model is the One You Don't Need to Train"

```python
class PhysicsInformedML:
    def __init__(self, domain_knowledge, data):
        self.physics = domain_knowledge  # What we know about the world
        self.patterns = data            # What we observe
        self.hybrid_model = None
    
    def solve(self):
        # Combine human knowledge with machine learning
        constraints = self.physics.get_conservation_laws()
        neural_net = self.build_network(self.patterns)
        
        # The magic: ML that respects physics
        self.hybrid_model = constrain(neural_net, constraints)
        return self.hybrid_model  # Faster, more accurate, interpretable
```
