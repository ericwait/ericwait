# Eric Wait, PhD

## Engineering Leader | Technical Mentor | GPU/ML Systems Architect

I build high-performance systems and the teams that sustain them. After leading cross-functional teams across academic research (HHMI Janelia), startup environments (Elephas Biosciences), and 21 years of military service, I'm transitioning into full-time technical leadership; mentoring the next generation to build production-ready systems with the same rigor and long-term thinking that has kept my open-source tools in use worldwide for 12+ years.

## What I Bring

### 🌉 Translation & Technical Leadership

Rare combination of PhD-level technical expertise in GPU-accelerated ML systems and exceptional ability to translate complexity into clarity. I bridge technical teams and product vision, speed development, and build team cohesion through empathetic mentorship.

### 🎯 Building What Lasts

I focus on sustainable, maintainable solutions over quick wins. My open-source tools have been in continuous development for 12+ years and are still actively used worldwide—because I build systems that serve real workflows, not impressive demos.

### 👥 Next-Generation Mentorship

I multiply impact through delegation and mentorship. After training personnel in high-stakes military operations, advising 170+ international scientists, and leading diverse software teams, I'm focused on developing technical leaders who combine engineering excellence with outcome-driven discipline.

### 💡 Outcome-Driven Discipline

Keep teams anchored to success criteria at every decision point—build what's needed, not what's possible. Published framework in *Journal of Cell Science* (2020): ["Hypothesis-driven quantitative fluorescence microscopy"](https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.250027).

## Featured Open-Source Projects

### ⚡ [Hydra Image Processor](https://github.com/ericwait/hydra-image-processor)

#### GPU-accelerated tensor operations library | Production ML infrastructure

**The Challenge:** Biological microscopy analysis too slow—days per dataset with traditional CPU methods.

**The Solution:** Custom CUDA kernels with accessible Python/MATLAB wrappers—leverage GPU acceleration without writing CUDA yourself.

**Impact:**

- 💯 **100x speedups** through GPU acceleration
- 🌍 **Global adoption** by elite research institutions worldwide
- 📚 **Published** in *Bioinformatics* (2019)
- ⏱️ **12+ years** continuous development (first commit August 2013)

**Key Innovation:** Accessible interfaces matter as much as raw performance—the best optimization is one people actually use.

**Technologies:** C++, CUDA, DirectX | Python/MATLAB bindings | CMake, vcpkg

[GitHub](https://github.com/ericwait/hydra-image-processor) • [MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/176123-hydra-image-processor) • [Publication](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz297)

### 🔬 [Direct 5D Viewer](https://github.com/ericwait/direct-5D-viewer)

#### Interactive visualization leveraging human visual perception | Real-time terabyte-scale rendering

**The Challenge:** 5D microscopy data (x, y, z, channels, time) is incomprehensible when collapsed into 2D projections—researchers draw false conclusions about spatial relationships.

**The Solution:** GPU-accelerated interactive visualization that exploits human vision strengths (motion detection, depth sensitivity, pattern recognition).

**Impact:**

- 👥 **Used by 170+ scientists** at HHMI Janelia and collaborating institutions
- 🔬 **Enabled discoveries** published in *Nature* and *Nature Communications*
- ✅ **Prevented algorithmic errors** through visual validation with polygon overlay
- 🎬 **Real-time rendering** with adjustable-speed temporal playback and stereoscopic 3D

**Key Innovation:** Technology should amplify human capability (visual perception), not replace it.

**Technologies:** C++ (79%), DirectX, HLSL shaders | MATLAB MEX interface | CMake

[GitHub](https://github.com/ericwait/direct-5D-viewer) • [MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/176924-direct-5d-viewer)

### 🧪 [MATLAB Utilities](https://github.com/ericwait/matlab-utilities)

#### A decade of modular problem-solving | Foundation for innovation

**The Philosophy:** Organize research code when you have 10 functions, not 1,000—modularity compounds, each reusable function becomes foundation for the next.

**The Solution:** Structured collection of microscopy analysis utilities treating research code like production software from day one.

**Impact:**

- 🏗️ **Foundation** for Hydra Image Processor and Direct 5D Viewer
- 🌍 **Used globally** at research institutions and collaborating laboratories
- 📅 **11+ years** continuous development (started 2013)
- 📖 **"Show your warts"** — Public development showing evolution, mistakes, and learning moments

**Key Innovation:** Unified reader/writer system for all microscope formats—write analysis code once, apply to any microscope data.

**Technologies:** MATLAB packages | JSON metadata | Multi-format support (TIFF, OME-TIFF, CZI, ND2)

[GitHub](https://github.com/ericwait/matlab-utilities) • [MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/176913-microscope-utilities)

### 📸 [Home Media AI](https://github.com/ericwait/home-media-ai)

#### ML-powered photo curation | Organizing 200K+ personal collections

**The Challenge:** Finding "great photos" in massive personal collections—combining technical metrics (sharpness, exposure) with subjective aesthetic judgment.

**The Solution:** Computer vision + YOLO object detection + hierarchical classification to surface the best images from 200,000+ photo libraries.

**Impact:**

- 🎯 **10x efficiency gain** — Review 2,000 candidates instead of 20,000 images
- 🗄️ **Scale-tested** on 700K+ file collections
- 🌲 **Flexible taxonomies** — Biological classification (World Flora Online), geographic hierarchies, custom categories
- 🔒 **Long-term reliability** — Checksummed tracking, never moves/deletes originals

**Key Innovation:** ML should multiply human capability, not replace it—surface the best candidates, let humans make final decisions.

**Technologies:** Python, SQLAlchemy, MariaDB | OpenCV, YOLO, scikit-learn | Jupyter Lab

*"The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera."* — Dorothea Lange

My professional photography training taught me pattern recognition that informs data visualization, compositional discipline that ensures reproducible systems, and a fundamental truth: **the best solution often requires subtracting, not adding**—whether in photographs, ML architectures, or team processes.
