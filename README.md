# Making Images Come to Light

<!-- Inspiration and directions from https://dev.to/codeloungedev/how-to-create-a-kickass-github-profile-page-408a -->

## Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Eric Wait.
I do image analysis and consultation for microscopy data in the [Advanced Imaging Center](https://aicjanelia.org) at [Janelia](https://janelia.org).
The Advanced Imaging Center (AIC) provides access to newly developed microscopes free to the rest of the world (see [applications](https://aicjanelia.org/apply)).
The microscopes available produce data beyond what is capable with commercial microscopes.
For this reason, I'm here to assist visitors on how to best process this data in a way that directly relates to their stated hypothesis.

The repositories that I maintain here are tools and processes that I have found useful for image processing.
Notable repositories are:

* [Hydra Image Processor](https://github.com/ericwait/hydra-image-processor) - a GPU accelerated image filtering toolkit that can be accessed from MATLAB or Python.
* [Direct 5-D Viewer](https://github.com/ericwait/direct-5D-viewer) - a DirectX viewer accessed from MATLAB that displays up to 5-D images.
    This viewer is best for transparent images (i.e. not EM data).
* [Matlab Utilities](https://github.com/ericwait/matlab-utilities) - a collection of Matlab functions that assist with image processing.
